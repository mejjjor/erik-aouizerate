I have built an interactive CV to allow my future coworkers to navigate and visualize my skills in a simple and concise way.  
Information can be filtered by date and by theme.

Three tools are available:

- Explore my skills with my [interactive CV](https://mejjjor.github.io/dataGraphExample/)  
- Create your own CV with [data-graph editor](https://mejjjor.github.io/dataGraphExample/editor.html)  
- Visualise your own CV with [data-graph visualisator](https://mejjjor.github.io/dataGraphExample/visualisator.html)

Source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mejjjor/dataGraph).
