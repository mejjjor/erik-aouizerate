I build an interactive CV to allow my futur coworkers to navigate and visualize my skills in simple and concise way.  
Informations could be filtered by date and by theme.

Tree tools are available:

- You can explore skill with my [interactive CV](https://mejjjor.github.io/dataGraphExample/)  
- You can create your own CV with [data-graph editor](https://mejjjor.github.io/dataGraphExample/editor.html)  
- You can visualize your own CV with [data-graph visualisator](https://mejjjor.github.io/dataGraphExample/visualisator.html)

Source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mejjjor/dataGraph).
