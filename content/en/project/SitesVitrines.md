I used the static site generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to create showcase web sites.

This web site could be hosted on a free server due to the fact it doesn't use backend. Also the security is high because the system is really simple. 

I built my personal [web site](http://erik-aouizerate.me) as well as my friend [ManoÃ«l Mathis](http://www.manoel-artiste.fr) who works in arts.

This technology is developer friendly, so I have created documentation to help : [docs](http://erik-aouizerate.me/docs/mano/).
