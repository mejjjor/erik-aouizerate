I used static site generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to create showcase web sites.

This web sites could be host on free server because it don't need backend. Also the security is high because the system is really simple. 

I build my personal [web site](http://erik-aouizerate.me) and a friend web site who's working in art : [ManoÃ«l Mathis](http://www.manoel-artiste.fr).

This technology is developper friendly, so I create documentation to help : [docs](http://erik-aouizerate.me/docs/mano/).
